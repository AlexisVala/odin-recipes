    <h2>What Makes This Fried Chicken So Delicious?</h2>
    <p>There are a few reasons this fried chicken is so delicious:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Allowing the buttermilk-flour mixture to come to a paste-like consistency
            is key to a crispiness on the outside and juiciness on the inside.</li>
        <li>Most fried chicken is cooked at a high temperature throughout the frying
            process. This one, however, only starts at a very high heat — after browning,
            the heat is reduced for about 30 minutes. You'll turn up the temperature again
            at the end, locking in that crispy texture.</li>
